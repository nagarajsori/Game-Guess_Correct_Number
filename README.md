# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is a simple command-line **Number Guessing Game** written in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback on whether the number is higher or lower than the guess.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program provides feedback:
  - "Higher number please!" if the guess is too low.
  - "Lower number please!" if the guess is too high.
- The loop continues until the correct number is guessed.
- Once guessed correctly, the program prints how many attempts it took.

## ðŸ§  Example

```
Guess the number: 50  
Higher number please!  
Guess the number: 75  
Lower number please!  
Guess the number: 63  
Higher number please!  
Guess the number: 68  
You have guessed the correct number 68 in 4 attempts.
